</svelte:head>

<p class="lede">Hi, I’m Isaac Morrier.</p>

<p class="lede">I study branding, products, people, material culture, and the effects technology has on all of these things and help companies create competitive advantage with that insight.</p>

<p>Lately I wrote the strategy for an international soda redesign, launched an energy bar you could order via text message, tweeted llama gifs for a $2 trillion bank, found a new identity for America’s oldest performance running shoe brand, positioned zero-amenity micro-apartments, found a universal language for recycling, growth-hacked coffee, and helped launch the unofficial memecoin of Hustle Twitter.</p>

<p>These are some of the things I care about:</p>
<ul>
	<li>people</li>
	<li>the future</li>
	<li>typography</li>
</ul>

<p>These are some of the things I don’t care about:</p>

<ul><li>Any World Series outcome after 2004</li></ul>

<p>I currently work as a strategist at Design Army in Washington, DC and previously at Verb Energy, DigitasLBi, Trinity Mobile Networks, SapientNitro, and the Behavioral Research Lab at the Yale School of Management. I graduated from Yale University with my B.A. in Sociology in 2017.</p>

<p>Humans who want to work with me can contact me at isaac@isaacmorrier.com.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Isaac</p>
